# LPRnet-keras
A keras implementation of the network proposed in https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10447
## Notes
1. Utilizes separable convolutional layers as opposed to the normal convolutional layers used in the paper.
2. Training data is generated at train time. 
3. Dataset generation adopted from 
4. Dataset augmentation adopted from the proposed system in https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06949, code available at https://github.com/roatienza/straug
